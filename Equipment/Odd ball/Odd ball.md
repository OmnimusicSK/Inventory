## Quick Start Guide

Download the Odd Ball app from the [app store (iPhone)](<https://apps.apple.com/us/app/odd-ball/id1453989732>) or [google play store (Android)](<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oddballism.app&hl=en_GB&gl=US>).

Run the app and follow the on-screen instructions.

There are many different modes and ways the odd ball can be used. Unfortunately, the app layout differs on Android and iPhone/iPad, but the sample triggering mode is likely most useful for a quick interaction.

There are some odd ball tutorials, but as this a developing product, the instructions may be out of date:

## Troubleshooting

If the Odd Ball does not respond when trying to connect, make sure it is charged. There is no on/off switch - the device simply switches out of standby when it detects movement. As a result it will lose charge quickly.
