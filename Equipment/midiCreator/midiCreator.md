## Quick Start Guide

This equipment is rarely used, but powerful. It effectively allows you to build a custom instrument for any user, with nearly any access requirement. You do this by attaching the required sensors and switches to the box and then configuring how they are used. The voltages produced by your inputs are converted to MIDI in myriad ways. Unfortunately, resources for this device are (very) thin on the ground, so this instrument requires specific training.

MIDI Creator was produced by The University of York Electronics Sensor around 1994. It is a well designed, useful device but outdated.
