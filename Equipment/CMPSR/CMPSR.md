Plug in the CMPSR, using the included USB-C cable. It should start up and show up as a MIDI input in your operating system. 
You can then use it to make musical notes in any DAW (Digital Audio Workstation), such as garageBand, thumbJam, ableton live, logic, etc.

## Troubleshooting

-BLE (bluetooth) MIDI is initialised by pressing the small button underneath the controller. Howver, it does not appear to be working (the pairing process does not complete) as of 08/01/2024. Use wired only for now.

-Power on/off by holding the button on the underside.

-Reset by holding the two top buttons for a few seconds.
